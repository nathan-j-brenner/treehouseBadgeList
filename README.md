# treehouseBadgeList

##Goal: Create a page that will shows which what currently enrolled students in Web Foundations have completed in Treehouse compared to the intended badges selected by the instructors.  This will be displayed in a table.  The first row will display each assigned badge. The first column will display the name of each student.  Each intersection of student name and badge should indicate if that student has or has not compeleted that badge.

1. Create a javaScript function that takes an array of badge names and lists each badge name as a heading of a column in an html table

2. Create a javaScript function that takes an array of student names and lists each student name as a heading of a row beneath the badge name row.

(Nate completed this, but he got stuck on how to write the code that creates one table with box functions listing the student names and badges so he created two tables.  A third table could be created for the intersections, but he's not going to figure that out until he can find the intersection of the two lists for a single student)

3. create a function that will take each student name and locate the badges completed from treehouse (json data) and compare what badges that student has completed against the badges recommended.

4. style the page so that the information can be read quickly (use colors red and green for intersections)

5. revise what badges students should complete and communicate with students what badges they should complete.
